# Booth Algorithm Operation

The Booth algorithm is an efficient technique for performing binary multiplications using additions, carries, and shifts. This algorithm is particularly useful for multiplying binary numbers with signed representation.

## Number Representation

Before delving into the Booth algorithm's operation, it's essential to understand the representation of numbers in two's complement. In this system, positive and negative numbers are represented in such a way that the most significant bit (the leftmost bit) indicates the sign. A "0" in the most significant bit represents a positive number, while a "1" denotes a negative number. The other bits represent the absolute value of the number.

## Algorithm Operation

The Booth algorithm uses two registers: one for the multiplicand and another for the multiplier. Both registers shift to the right during the process. The algorithm operates in cycles until a stop condition is met.

The Booth algorithm's cycle of operation is based on examining the two least significant bits of the multiplier:

- If these two bits are "00" or "11," the cycle continues. This means that there is no need for addition or subtraction in this step.
- If the two least significant bits are "01," an addition is performed (adding the multiplicand to the accumulator).
- If the two least significant bits are "10," a subtraction is carried out (subtracting the multiplicand from the accumulator). Subtraction is preferred to avoid the use of two's complement operations.

The cycle repeats until the two least significant bits of the multiplier are different from "00" or "11."

## General Process

In summary, the process followed in the Booth algorithm is as follows:

1. Examination of the two least significant bits of the multiplier.
2. Addition or subtraction based on the values of these bits.
3. Right-shift of both registers.
4. Comparison of the two least significant bits to determine if the cycle stops.
5. Upon meeting the stop condition, the desired value is obtained.
6. Subsequently, a right shift of two bits is performed for both registers.

It is essential to note that in some implementations, such as in microprocessors, addition or subtraction operations may be used to accelerate the process and enhance the algorithm's efficiency.

The Booth algorithm finds wide applications in computer architecture and embedded systems for efficient binary multiplication. Understanding its operation is crucial for optimizing mathematical operations in digital systems.
